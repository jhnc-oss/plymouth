.SH NAME
plymouth \- A graphical boot system and logger

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B plymouth
is a graphical boot system for Linux which takes advantage of the
kernel-based mode setting (KMS) available for modern graphic cards to
provide a seamless, flickerfree and attractive boot screen. It allows
to choose between various, static or animated graphical themes to spruce
up the startup and avoid the noise generated by the vast amount of kernel
messages while the machine boots into the graphical server. On systems
where kernel-based mode setting is not available, plymouth falls back to
a text mode boot screen which provides a simple progress bar to provide
feedback during boot.
.P
In order for the configured default plymouth theme to be loaded during
boot, the option `splash' (or `rhgb' for backward compatibility with the
RHGB boot splash) must be provided at the kernel command line. Without
this command line option, plymouth will default to showing detailed boot
output.
.P
During the boot process, the user can switch between the graphical theme
and the detailed boot output using the Escape key.

.SH AUTHORS

originally written by Ray Strode and has had significant contributions

Adam Jackson, Frederic Crozat and others.
